## Aims

The aim of this project is to implement a connected ECG sensing system,
utilising the Texas Instruments MSP432 Microcontroller, and IoT analytics
platform ThingSpeak. The system must take heart rate measurements, via a
designed bioamplifier circuit using the standard lead configurations, using the
MSP432 Microcontroller. These measurements must then be transmit to ThingSpeak
via a HTTP POST command, at which point they can be analysed using MATLAB
scripts on ThingSpeak. Finally, results must be compared to that of another
group.

This project aims to improve the students familiarity with bioamplifier
circuits, measurements of biopotential values, and with connected services, in
the ThingSpeak implementation.
