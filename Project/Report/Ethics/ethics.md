# Ethics

There are a number of ethical issues associated with the capture and storage of
personal data. Uploading data using the implementation in this project, data
could be intercepted, allowing the person intercepting it access to all of the
data. Data should be uploaded by more secure means, and stored in an encrypted
format. This would prevent any data which may be intercepted from being used.
The data being stored is also not being stored with personal data protection
regulations, such as GDPR, in mind. A more complete solution would allow for
encrypted data to be uploaded, and would store this data in a secure way, not
easily accessible.
