# Software

There are three main aspects to the software portion of this project. These are
the ECG Sampling, the transfer of sampled data to ThingSpeak, and the MATLAB
analysis of the data available on ThingSpeak. Due to limitations with
ThingSpeaks update frequency, proper sampling results were required to be
uploaded in bulk to the site.
