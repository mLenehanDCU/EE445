First recording (starts at event labelled 'EEG with changing eye
conditions'): Subject was relaxed with eyes closed for about 20 seconds,
then opened eyes for 20 seconds, then closed eyes until end of
recording.

The EEG data is shown as follows:

 CH 1 recorded EEG

 CH 40 alpha rhythm: 8-13 Hz

 CH 41 beta rhythm: 13-30 Hz

 CH 42 delta rhythm: 1-5 Hz

 CH 43 theta rhythm: 4-8 Hz

### A. EEG Amplitude Measurements

: Table 3.2 Standard Deviation \[Stddev\]

 |***Rhythm***| ***CH\ Measurement***|***Eyes\ Closed***|***Eyes\ Open***|***Eyes\ Re-closed***|
 |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
 |Alpha|40\ Stddev|7.306776uV|3.227038uV|6.918106uV|
 |Beta|41\ Stddev|3.407296uV|2.941546uV|3.481899uV|

 |Theta|43\ Stddev|5.008476uV|2.817929uV|4.516996uV|

### B.  EEG Frequency Measurements from first 'Eyes closed' data.

Complete Table 3.3 with the frequencies for each rhythm and calculate
the mean frequency. Freq measurement applies to all channels since it is
calculated from the horizontal time scale, but you must select the
correct area in each band.

## II.  Questions

### C. List and define two characteristics of regular, periodic waveforms.

Regular, periodic waveforms are characterised by their amplitude, given in
microvolts, i.e.  the magnitude of the wave, and their frequency, given in
Hertz, i.e. the number of complete cycles per seconds.

### D. Compare and contrast synchrony and alpha block.

Synchrony is when the peaks and troughs of the brain waves occur at the same
time, giving constructive interference, and an overall greater sum of activity
for alpha waves.
Alpha block is the term used to describe destructive interference, or
counterbalance which occurs in the electrical activity giving an overall sum
value which is not truly representative of the beta wave activity.

### E. Examine the alpha and beta waveforms for change between the “eyes closed” state and the “eyes open” state.

i. Does **desynchronization** of the alpha rhythm occur when the eyes are open?

Desynchronization does occur when the eyes are open. This is described as alpha
block, as explained in section D.

ii. Does the beta rhythm become more pronounced in the “eyes open”
state?

The beta rhythm does not become more pronounced in the eyes open state, contrary
to the expected results of increased beta wave amplitude with concentration.

### F. The amplitude measurements (Stddev) are indicative of how much alpha activity is occurring in Subject. But, the amplitude values for beta do not truly reflect the amount of mental activity occurring with the eyes open. Explain.

The values measured for the beta waves amplitude are not truly reflective of the
mental activity occurring, as, due to desynchronization, the negative and
positive activities counterbalance, causing it to appear as if less electrical
activity is taking place. It can be seen from the measurements that the beta
wave amplitude decreased when the subjects eyes were open. This may be an
indication of the desynchronization, or may have been due to experimental error
in the measurements.

### G. Examine the delta and theta rhythm. Is there an increase in delta and theta activity when the eyes are open? Explain your observation.

There is a decrease in both delta and theta waves when eyes are open. Delta
wave activity decrease from approximately 4/4.5uV to 3.7uV when the subjects
eyes are open. Theta waves decrease from approximately 4.5/5uV to 2.8uV.

These decreases in amplitude are due to the relationship between delta and theta
waves, and REM and deep sleep stages respectively. While there is also a
relationship between these rhythms and intense concentration, the subject was in
a relaxed state with their eyes open, and, as such, no stimulus occurred.

### H.  Define the following terms:

i. Alpha rhythm

Alpha rhythms are the most prominent EEG waves in a relaxed. but  awake adult
with their eyes closed. With eyes open, the amplitude of the alpha waves are
reduced. Alpha rhythms are different in each area of the brain, with the highest
amplitudes found in the occipital and parietal regions. The frequency of alpha
waves ranges from 8-12Hz.

ii. Beta rhythm

Beta rhythms occur during deep sleep, or during periods of alertness and
concentration. Their amplitudes are lower than that of alpha waves. Beta wave
activity is associated with retrieval of memory. The frequency at which beta
waves occurs is in the range of 12 to 30Hz.

iii. Delta rhythm

Delta waves are high amplitude, low frequency brain waves. They are associated
with deep sleep, however, can also increase during intense concentration. The
frequency of delta waves ranges from 1-5Hz.

iv. Theta rhythm

Theta rhythms again are high amplitude, low frequency waves, which occur during
deep sleep. The frequency ranges between 4 and 8 Hz.
