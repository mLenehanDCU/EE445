First segment (starts at event labeled 'Count and touch'): Subject quietly
answers questions, counts backwards from 10, counts backwards from 30 by
subtracting increasing odd numbers and then is touched on face.

Second segment (starts at event labeled 'Colored squares'): Viewing a series of
colored squares.

Third segment (starts at event labeled 'Yes-No questions'): Answering a series
of 'Yes' or 'No' questions.

# II. Questions

## D. Of what practical value is the EDA information obtained from the color experiment?

The EDA values measured during the colour experiment describe the subjects
emotional respone, as a change in emotional respose will cause a change in
autonomic tone.

# E. What major physiological changes account for the electrodermal activity?

Changes in autonomic tone, which alters sweating and cutaneous blood flow,
change electrodermal activity. An increase in sweating can lower electrical
resistance, which is the inverse of conductance, which EDA is measured in.

## F. Give three reasons why polygraph testing of a person’s sincerity and honesty may yield inconclusive results.

1. A persons nerves may affect readings, giving false positives for lies.
2. Polygraph tests may be cheated by applying a physical stimulus, for example a
   pin prick, during control questions. This will produce a response similar to
   those produced when the subject is lying, thus giving inconclusive results.
3. Electrical measurements made are subject to error in analysis.
