Note Interpreting ECGs is a skill that requires practice to
distinguish between normal variation and those arising from medical
conditions. Do not be alarmed if your ECG does not match the “Normative"
values and references above and in the Introduction.

# II. Questions

## D. Using data from table 5.2:

1. **Explain the changes in heart rate between conditions. Describe the
physiological mechanisms causing these changes.**

There is an increase in average heart rate between the supine and seated
conditions. This is due to the effects gravity has on blood flow when sitting,
meaning pumping has to occur at a faster rate to meet the needs of the body.

There is a decrease in average heart rate between the seated and start of inhale
conditions. This is an unexpected result, and likely due to the recording taking
place after moving from the supine to seated position quite quickly, as usually
the heart rate would increase with inhalation, as there is a decrease in
systemic arterial blood pressure, reducing carotid baroreceptor firing.

There is an decrease in average heart rate between the start of inhale and start
of exhale conditions. This is due to an increase in systemic arterial blood
pressure  and cardiac output cause an increase in carotid baroreceptor firing,
which in turn causes the heart rate to decrease.

There is a large increase in average heart rate between the start of exhale and
after exercise conditions. This is due to the excess of oxygen and blood flow
required to be pumped to the extremities during intense physical activity. 

2. **Are there differences in the cardiac cycle with the respiratory cycle
(recording 3 data)?**

Yes, there are differences, as with an increase in respiration, for example in
the after exercise condition, there is an increase in hear rate.

## E. Using data from table 5.3:

**What changes occurred in the duration of systole and diastole between
resting and post exercise?**

The durations of systole and diastole both decreased after exercise, with a
larger decrease occurring in ventricular diastole when compared with ventricular
systole.

## F.Using data from tables 5.4 and 5.5:

1. **Compared to the resting state, do the durations of the ECG intervals
and segments decrease during exercise? Explain:**

The durations of the ECG intervals and segments decrease during exercise when
compared with the resting state. This is due to the increase in heart rate which
occurs during exercise, meaning that intervals and segments are shorter in
duration.

2. **Compare your ECG data to the normative values. Explain any
differences.**

With the exception of the Q-T and R-R interval and T-P segment durations in the supine
condition, and the T wave amplitude, P-R, and R-R interval duration in the after
exercise conditions, all data was within the given normative values. The
observed differences may be due to the unclear start and end point of the
measurements, due to an unsteady isoelectric line.

3. **Compare ECG data with other groups in your laboratory. Do their data
differ? Explain why this may not be unusual.**

Compared to other ECG data, their are differences in measurement values, however
this is not unusual, as factors such as fitness and age have an impact on the
heart rate of the individual being tested.

## G. In order to beat, the heart needs three types of cells. Describe the cells and their function.

1. Rhythm generators generate electrical signals 
2. Conductors which spread the pacemaker signal
3. Contractile cells which mechanically pump blood

## H. List in proper sequence, starting with the normal pacemaker, elements of the cardiac conduction system.

1. Sinoatrial Node
2. Internodal Pathways
3. Atrial Fibers
4. Atrioventricular Node
5. Bundle of His
6. Left Bundle Branch
7. Right Bundle Branches
8. Purkinje Fibers 

## I. Describe three cardiac effects of increased sympathetic activity, and of increased parasympathetic activity.

**Sympathetic**

An increase in sympathetic activity causes:

1. An increase in automaticity and excitability of the SA Node, giving increased
   heart rate
2. An increase in electrical impulse conductivity through atrioventricular conduction system
3. An increase in atrioventricular contraction

**Parasympathetic**

An increase in parasympathetic activity causes:

1. A decrease in automaticity and excitability of the SA Node, giving a
   decreased heart rate
2. A decrease in electrical impulse conductivity through the atrioventricular
   conduction system
3. A decrease in the force of atrioventricular contraction

## J. In the normal cardiac cycle, the atria contract before the ventricles. Where is this fact represented in the ECG?

This can be seen in the P-R interval, which is the time from the onset of atrial
depolarization to the onset of ventricular depolarization.

## K.What is meant by “AV delay” and what purpose does the delay serve? 

AV delay is the approximately 0.20 seconds between the depolarization of the
atria due to the SA node impulse, and the contraction of the ventricles. This is
due to the non-conducting tissue found between the atria and ventricles. The
purpose of this delay is to ensure the blood has been pumped from the atria to
the ventricles before the ventricles contract to pump the blood around the rest
of the body.

## L.What is the isoelectric line of the ECG?

It is a point of departure of electrical activity if depolarization and
repolarizations of the cardiac cycle, indicating periods when the ECG electrodes
did not detect electrical activity.

## M.Which components of the ECG are normally measured along the isoelectric line?

All waves - P, QRS complex, and T waves -, intervals - P-R, Q-T, and R-R -, and
segments - P-R, S-T, and T-P - are measured along the isoelectric line.
