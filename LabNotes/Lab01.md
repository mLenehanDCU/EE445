# Electromyography

## Background

- Investigating properties of skeletal muscle
- Human body has 3 types of muscle tissue
 - Each performs specific tasks to maintain homeostasis
 - **Cardiac Muscle**
  - Found only in heart
  - Contracts - Blood circulates, delivers nutrients to cell, removes cell waste
 - **Smooth Muscle**
  - In walls of hollow organs e.g. intestines, blood vessels, lungs
  - Contraction changes inner diameter of hollow organs
  - Used to regulate passage of material through digestive tract, control blood
    pressure and flow, regulate airflow during respiratory cycle
 - **Skeletal Muscle**
  - Usually attached to skeleton
  - Contraction moves one part of body wrt another part, e.g. flexing forearm
  - Contraction of several in coordinated mamnner moves entire body e.g. walking
- Primary Function
 - Convert chemical energy to mechanical work, in doing so, muscle
   shortens/contracts
- Human skeletal musle
 - Hundreds of individually cylindrically shaped cells - fibers bound by
   connective tissue
 - Muscles stimulated to contract by somatic motor nerves carry signals in form
   of nerve impulses from brain/spinal cord to skeletal muscles
- Axons (Nerve Fibers)
 - Long cylindrical extensions of neuronss
 - Leave spinal cord via spiinal nerves
 - Leave brain via cranial nerves
 - Distributes to appropriate skeletal muscles in form of peripheral nerve
   (cable like collection of individual nerve fibers)
 - On reaching muscle, each nerve fiber branches and innervates several
   individual muscle fibers
 - Single motor neuron can innervate severl muscle fibers, each muscle fiber
   innervated by only one motor neuron
 - Single motor neruon + muscle fibers it controls = motor unit
- When somatic motor neuron activated, all fibers it innervates respond to
  neurons impulses by generating their own electrical signals that lead to
  contraction of activated muscle fibers
 1. Activating desired number of motor units within muscle
 2. Controlling frequency of motor neuron impulses in each motor unit
- When increase in strngth of muscles contraction necessary, brain increases
  number of simultaneously active motor units within muscle
 - Proces called motor unit recruitment
- *Tonus*
 - Constant state of slight tension that serves to maintain muscle in state of
   readiness
 - Tonus due to alternate periodic activation of small no. of motor units within
   muscle by motor centers in brain and spinal cord
 - Smooth controlled movements of body produced by graded contraction of
   skeletal muscles
 - **Grading**
  - changing strngth of muscle contraction/extent of shortening in proportion to
    load placed on muscle
 - Skeletal muscles able to react to different loads accordingly
- When motor unit activated, component muscle fibers generate/conduct their own
  electrical impulses ultimately result in contraction of fibers
- Electrical impulses very weak (100microvovlts), fibers conducting
  simultaneously induce voltage differences in skin large enough to be detected
- Detection, amplification, recording of changes in skin voltage produced in
  underlying skeletal muscle contraction called electromyography
 - Recording obtained called Electromyogram (EMG)
- EMG signal recorded consequence of two bioelectric activities
 1. Propagation on motor nerve impulses and transmission of neuromuscular
    junctions of motor neurons
 2. Propagation of muscle impulses by sarcolemma and T-tubular system resulting
    in excitation-contraction coupling
 - Magnitude of action potentials of active motor units not all same nor in
   phase with one another
 - Timing sequence of motor unit activation is variable
 - Net result of these and other factors is complex EMG signal
 - Recording of activity as detected by surface electrodes
  - Propagation of muscle and nerve impulses involves
    depolarization/repolarization phonomena
   - Spikes therefore, have negative and positive component and amplitudes
     influenced by location of recording electrodes wrt number of active
     underlying skeletal muscles and motor nerve fibers
 - Integrated EMG = alternate view of EMG signal
  - Clearly shows pattern of muscle activity
  - Averages out noise spikes in raw EMG data to provide more accurate
    indication of EMG output level
  - Calculates mean of data by rectifying points in sample range (invert all
    negative values) then computing mean
