# The Cell and Action Potentials

## The Cell

- Basic building block of human body
- Same funciton grouped to form
 - Tissues - Muscles, Nerves, Blood, Bones, Cartilage
- 2+ tissues of dissimilar physiology form organs
 - Heart, Lungs, Kidneys, etc.
- Several organs constitute system
 - digestive system, respiratory system etc.
- Interstitial fluid
 - Provides nourishment to cell
 - Removes waste
 - Responds to electrochemical impulses

### Average Human Cell

- Nearly Spherical
- $20\micro m$ diameter
- Semipermeable outer membrane, 100 Angstrom units thick
- Inner fluid, cytoplasm, comprising of organelles and inclusions
 - Organelles: Small internal living organs of cell
 - Inclusions: Non-living accumulation of metabolites such as fats/carbs
- Inner control unit, nucleus, enclosed by membrane, filled with nucleoplasm
 - Includes nucleoli containing RNA and DNA
  - Determine specific biochemical characteristics of cell type
  - Control metabolic activities

### Cell Metabolism: Membrane Transport

- Cell uses 3 processes for nourishment and waste expulsion across membrane:
 - Diffusion:
  - Movement of substance from regions of high concentration
  - Influenced by factors such as:
   - Membrane permeability
   - Relative concentration of internal and external substances
   - Electrical potential inside/outside cell
   - Pressure difference across membrane

### Resting Potential

- Cell membrane separates interstitial fluid from intracellular fluid,
  maintaining markedly different concentrations of ions inside/outside cell
 - Concentration of Sodium and Chloride ions much higher in interstitial fluid
 - Concentration of Potassium ions much higher in intracellular fluid
 - Skeletal muscle cells:
  - Insidel cell: Negative potential difference, approx. -90mV, relative to
  interstitial fluid
  - Resting Potential of Cell
- Resting cell membrane:
 - Highly permeable to potassium
 - Slightly permeable to sodium
 - Potassium leaks out as high rate of equilibrium reached when tendency for
   potassium to defuse out is balanced by resulting electric field
- Metabolic proceses of cell actively transport sodium ions out of cell,
  potassium ions into cell, opposition to chemical gradient

### Action Potential

- Cell receives electrical stimulus above threshold value
 - Electrochemical balance upset
 - Cell goes through Action Potential cycle
 - Can result in electrochemical impulses transmit from cell to cell
- Results from change in membrane permeability at point of stimulation
 - Permeability to sodium ions increased
 - Sodium ions flow into cell
 - Outer side of cell momentarily more negative than interior
  - Depolarisation
 - Cell potential changed to approx. +20mV
 - Cell returns to resting permeability
  - Potassium ions defuse outwards
  - Cell returns to resting potential, approx. -90mV
  - Repolarization
- Action Potential Timescale
 - 1ms in nerve/muscle cells
 - 150-300ms in heart cells
- Bioelectronic currents due to + and - ions in conducting fluid
- Finite rise/fall time of cell action potential arises from:
 - Mass of ions
 - Resistance to movement through fluid/across membrane

- Ionic concentration gradient across membrane maintained by sodium and
  potassium pump
 - Sodium withdrawn from cell against both charge and concentration gradients
   supported by high-energy phosphate compound ATP
 - Rate of pumping proportional to sodium concentration in cell
 - Operation of pump delivers potassium ions into cell
- Cell may be stimulated/caused to depolarise/repolarise by subjecting membrane
  to ionic current above certain min. value
 - Stimulus Threshold, typically -60mV
 - If stimulus less than threshold/too short duration, cell won't depolarise
- Action potential always same for given cell, irrespective of thresh. intensity
  of stimulus
- Following generation of action potential, brief period where cell cannot
  respond to new stimulus
 - Absolute Refactory Period - approx. 1ms in nerve cells
- May also have relative refactory period
 - Another action potential can be triggered
 - Much stronger stimulation needed
- Once thresh. reached, polarisation/depolarisation sequence can't be turned
  off/changed, regardless of length/further presence of stimulus
- Second stimulus won't have effect while cell in depolarising phase
- Theshold level can be increased/decreased by:
 - Altering membrane permeability
 - Changing concentration of potassium, sodium, calcium etc
 - Introducing other chemicals to fluid around cell

### Bioelectric Potentials

- Combined effects of coordinated electrochemical action potentials of large
  groups of cells is basic source of Bioelectric Potentials
- Charge mitigation through body fluids constitute electric current setting up
  potential differences between various part of body including outer surface
- Can measure potential differences by placing electrodes on outer surface of
  body, amplifying voltages with sensitive amplifiers
