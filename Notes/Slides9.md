# Defibrillators and Pacemakers

## Heart Arrythmia

- Tachycardia
 - HR too fast - above 100BPM in adults
- Bradycardia
 - HR too slow - below 60BPM
- Heart Arrythmia (aka cardiac dysrhythmia or irregular heartbeat)
 - Group of conditions in which heartbeat irregular, too fast/slow
 - Due to problems with electrical conduction system of the heart
 - may be symptomless or symptoms may include palpitations or feeling a pause
   between heartbeats, lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath or
   chest pain
 - Most types of arrythmia are not serious
 - Some predispose a person to complications such as stroke/heart failues
 - others may result in cardiac arrest
- Four main types of arryth ia
 - Extra beats (premature areial/ventricular/jumctional contractions)
 - Supraventricular tachycardias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter,
   paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia)
 - Ventricular arrythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia)
 - Bradyarrythmias (slow heart rate, below 60BPM or above 60BOM but considered
   too slow for individuals current medical condition)

## Fibrillation

- Rapid, irregular, and unsynchronized contraction of muscle fibers
- Ventricular fibrillation
 - Ventricles of heart are in fibrillation
 - Regularity
  - No regularity shape shape of WRS complez because all electrical activity is
    disorganised
 - Rate
  -
 - P wave
  -
 - PR interval
  -
 - QRS complex
  -
- Ventricular tachycardia
 -
- Torsades de Point (TdP)
 -
- Atrial Fibrillation
 - Atrial portion of heart is in fibrillation, out of sync with ventricles
 - LEss blood under less pressure for ventricles to pump to lungs and the body

## Defirbrillation

- Electrical device that delivers a pulse of theraputic current (countershock)
  to reverse ventricular fibrillation or life threatening ventricular
  tachycardia in heart
- Depolarizes large amount of heart muscle, ending dysrhythmia
- Subsequently bodys natural pacemaker in SA node able to re-establish normal
  sinus rhythm
- In contrast to defibrillation, synchronized cardioversion is an electrical
  shock delivered in synchrony to cardiac cycle, aiming to end poorly perfusing
  cardiac dysrhytmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia
- Applied current pulse needs to be carefully controlled
 - Too small, causes fibrillation
 - Too large, burn injuries

## Common defibrillation waveforms
