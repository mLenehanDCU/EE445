# Organic Bioelectronics

- Deals with pplication of carbon-based semiconductors in form of conjugted small
  molecules and pilymers in electronic, optoelectronic devices.
- 'Soft' nature means organic electronic materials offer range of advantages,
  including
 - Synthetic tunability of their electronic properties
 - Low temp processing
 - Better mechanical compatibility with tussue than trad. 'hard' electronic
   materials
 - Improved compatability with mechanically flexible substrates (suits
   non-planar shapes required for implants)

- Ability of organic electronic materials to ocnduct ions, in addition to
  electrons and holes, opens new communication channel with biology due to
  importance of ion fluxes in biological systems
- Van der Waals bonding leads to well-defined intimate interfaces with
  electrolytes without dangling bonds or oxides
- Organic Bioelectronics concerned with bi-directional coupling of organic
  electronic/optoelectronic

## Biology

- Nature has developed toolkit of biomaterials capab;le of recognition
 - Enzymes that metabolize substrates
 - Oligonucleotides that hybridize with complementary strands
 - Antigens that pair with antibodies
- Much interest in coupling such biomaterials with electronic devices to build
  biosensors
- Biomaterial constitutes biorecognition element that provides specificity
- Electronic device is transducer that translates recognition event into
  measureable signal
- Key challenge
 - Couple biorecognition element with transducer to maximize information
   transfer to transducer upon recognition event
- One biosensor on which much effort has been expended - Glucose Monitor
- Majority of commercially available glucose monitors are electrochemical
  sensors
- Modern glucose monitors utilize redox enzymes such as glucose oxidase to
  detect glucose
 - Metabolizez glucose in cycle that involves electron transfer
 - Electrons

- Reactions involved in detection of glucose
 - Oxidized by enzyme glucose oxidase
 - In turn reduced and cycles back by producing hydrogen peroxide
 - H2O2 can be oxidized by depositing an electron on suitable metal surface
 - Current flows in metal electrode reflects glucose concentration

- Until advent of Organic Thin-Film Transistors (OTFTs) development of
  transducer sidfe had not progressed significantly
- OTFTs are a key development allowing the transduction tech to move from
  electrochemistry to bioelectronics

## Organic Electrochemical Transistor (OECT)

- Example of OFT consists of a conducting polymer film (transistor channel) oin
  direct contact with an electrolute
- Drain current controlled by injection of ions from electrolute into a
  semiconductor channel
- Injection of ions in channel controlled through application of a voltage to
  the gate electrode, which immersed in the electrolyte controls the doping
  level of the conducting polymer channel
- When V applied to gate, ions from electrolyte injected in channel, change
  electronic charge density, hence drain current
- When V removed, inkjection ions returns to electrolyte, drain current goes
  back to original value
- Potential for applications in biosensors, bioelectronics and large-area
  low-cost devices

- Differentfrom electrolyte-gated FET, where ions do not penetrate into the
  channel, but accumulate near surface of dielectric layer deposited on the
  channel, which induces accumulation of electric charge inside the channel,
  near the surface.
- In OECTs, ions injected into channel and change electronic charge density
  throughput its volume
- Advantages of OECTs:
