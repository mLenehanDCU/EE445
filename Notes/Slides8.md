# Respiration

## The Respiratory System

- Respiration
 - Chemical provess of releasing energy from organic compouds.
 - Can be either aerobic (uses O2) and anaerobic (no O2)
 - Often used as synonym for breathing
- Gas exchange
 - Movement of O2 into organism and CO2 out of an organism
- Breathing
 - ventilation moovements needed in some larger animals so efficient gas
   exchange can take place
 - Involves airways, ribs, intercostal muscles, diaphragm and lungs
  - Known as respiratory system
- In mammals, gases exchanged between red blood cells and air in alveoli
- Alveoli are tiny sacks with very thin walls ensuring that the nnumerous
  cappilaries that surroud them are very

## Measuring Respiration

- Plays a central role in peripheral autonomic system
- Rhythm of breathing can be found in fluctuations of blood pressure, vascular
  resistance, pupil diameter, and short term HR variability'
- Accesing respiratory activity may help in investigating changes foud in other
  physioogical subsystem of the body
- Respiratory rhythm in particular is vital parameter used to detect
  paathological changes of breathing
- Wish to measure two aspects of respiration: freq of breaths and their depth
- Unlike heart, lungs fo not generate electrical signals which can be easily
  detected
- chest movement aside, two obvious physical effects correlated

## Measuring Respiration - Impedance plethusmography

- Lungs consist of large number of sacks of air surrounded by capillaries
 - Surrouding capillaries and tissue can be consifered to be conductive with low
   R
 - Air can be trated as insulator at DC
 - Lungs can be considered to have an inherent capacitance dependent on the
   volume of air contained in the
- Model of impedance at given point in time between two pointsss of te upper
  body as shown in right, where Ra, Rb, and Rc model resistanec of general body
  tissue while Rl and Cl model impedance of lungs

- By coimbining simplified electrical model of chest with electroe model frm
  before, overall equivalent circuit fr the tissue, includeing the lungs and
  air, and the electrofe sustems can be determined
- Here, determining Xl (the reactance resulting frm the air in the lungs) will

- Need two pairs of electroes
 - Need to take measurements at differene freq to characterise differenc
   reactance in the circuit
 - Different freq means that
  - cant directly combine results as phasors
  - Need to measure magnitude and phase of impedance in each case
  - need to used independent

- Summary
 - Breathing results in changes of air volume in the lungs which alters the
   electrical capacitance of the lungs
 - By measuring capacitance we can infer the volme of air in the lungs
 - If we
